Our scheduling platform is designed with the primary goal of prioritizing student mental health while optimizing their academic performance. Leveraging data from [Georgia Tech's course critique dataset](https://critique.gatech.edu/) for precise class scheduling and [Kaggle's student stress factors dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rxnach/student-stress-factors-a-comprehensive-analysis) for understanding stress factors, our tool employs advanced technologies to create efficient schedules tailored to individual preferences.

## Features

### 1. Data-driven Scheduling
- **Georgia Tech's Course Critique Dataset:** Utilized for accurate mapping to class schedules.
- **Google's Gemini API:** Employs generative AI to generate plausible timelines and incorporate stress relief activities.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Customized prompts are used to tailor the schedule based on user preferences and course load stress levels.

### 2. Health-focused Approach
- **Stress Level Detection:** Sample questions derived from exploratory analysis of the dataset are employed to detect stress levels related to student course load.
- **Major Factors:** Analysis indicates key factors affecting student mental health include:
  - Social Support
  - Teacher-Student Relationship
  - Bullying
  - Sleep Quality
  - Depression

### 3. Optimization for Performance and Recovery
- **Task Division:** Divides tasks and chores to optimize performance and recovery throughout the day.
- **Efficient Schedule Curation:** Curates schedules tailored to individual needs, balancing academic requirements with stress reduction.
